#### Using Bcrypt with MongoDB and React   
---   

**Make .env file in backend root** 

```
# backend/.env
PORT=8000
URL=mongodb+srv://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/AutobodyShop
```

**Created a fake admin user in `server.js` that reads from `admin_user.json` that can be used for Seed data** 

**Otherwise, just sign-up and create an account!**
